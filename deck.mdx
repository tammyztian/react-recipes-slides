# Recipes
- Higher Order Components (HOC)
- Render Props I
- Render Props II

---
# Why 
- Reusabe
- Single responsibility components
- Patterns used in many libraries 

^^ Redux, Apollo, React-Router

---

# Use case

- I have an API call I want to reuse
- I have a functionality I want to resue on different displays
- I am noticing I am writing a lot of the same code several times

---

# Example Three Ways

- User can get a cat image and cat breed from https://thecatapu.com
- Abstract the API call from the component
- Allow loading state
- Allow conditional rendering if cat breed isn't listed

---
# Higher Order Components

<CodeSurfer code="console.log('Hello, World!');" />
